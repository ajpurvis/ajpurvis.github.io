                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p>
                  Modeled a second-order pitch dynamic system for an AH-1 Cobra using Simulink. Designed and tested PID controllers to stabilize pitch axis rotation under command inputs and simulated wind disturbance. Compared multiple control configurations and visualized their stability, transient behavior, and steady-state error. Demonstrated the importance of proportional, integral, and derivative contributions.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                  Net Torque (&sum;&tau;), which is derived from Newton’s Second Law for rotational systems, is defined by the product of angular acceleration (&theta;&Prime;&Prime;) and a rigid body’s moment of inertia (I):
                </p>
                <div class="equation">&theta;&Prime;&Prime; = &sum;&tau; / I</div>
                <div class="equation">&sum;&tau; = &theta;&Prime;&Prime; &times; I</div>
              
                <p>
                  The net torque (&sum;&tau;) is composed of an input torque (M), counteracted by damping torque (D&theta;&Prime;) and stiffness torque (K&theta;):
                </p>
                <div class="equation">&sum;&tau; = M − D&theta;&Prime; − K&theta;</div>
              
                <p>
                  Inserting the net torque into the equation for angular acceleration gives:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">&theta;&Prime;&Prime; = (M − D&theta;&Prime; − K&theta;) / I</div>
              
                <p>
                  With angular acceleration (&theta;&Prime;&Prime;) fully defined in terms of torque, damping, stiffness, and inertia, the system’s response can be characterized under varying control inputs and disturbances.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  The Parallel Axis Theorem can be used to determine the moment of inertia (I) of a rigid body about any axis, given its moment of inertia about a parallel axis through its center of mass (I<sub>com</sub>). The relationship is defined by:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">I = I<sub>com</sub> + m &middot; h<sup>2</sup></div>
              
                <p>
                  I<sub>com</sub> is the moment of inertia of the helicopter’s fuselage about its own center of mass (CG), assuming it's a rigid body. Since we’re approximating the AH-1 Cobra fuselage as a uniform rectangular solid, we can use the classic formula:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">I<sub>com</sub> = (1/12) &middot; m &middot; (w<sup>2</sup> + h<sup>2</sup>)</div>
              
                <p>
                  Below, Figure 1 is used from <em>The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the World’s Modern Military Aircraft</em> as a starting point to determine and solve for many of the variables needed.

                  The height and width are given, the only quantity remaining is mass. The table below outlines a representative full combat load configuration for the AH-1 Cobra, operating near its maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 4,309 kg. This estimate includes a complete fuel load, pilot and gunner, and a full armament suite typical of heavy combat missions. While actual configurations may vary depending on mission profile and environmental conditions, this breakdown provides a realistic upper limit for operational weight planning.

              <p>
                With the known variables, the center of mass inertia can now be calculated:
              </p>
                <div class="equation">
                  I<sub>com</sub> = (1/12) &middot; 4309 &middot; (3.15<sup>2</sup> + 4.11<sup>2</sup>) = 9628 kg&middot;m<sup>2</sup>
                </div>
              
                <p>
                  To apply the Parallel Axis Theorem and estimate the helicopter's total moment of inertia, we must define the offset distance <em>h</em> — the distance between the helicopter’s CG and the axis of rotation. In this case, the axis of rotation is the pitch axis through the main rotor mast.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an exact center of gravity or mast schematic for the AH-1 Cobra is not publicly available, <em>h</em> is approximated based on fuselage length proportions. We assume the rotor mast sits at 55% of the fuselage length (measured from the tail), and the center of gravity at 45%. This yields:
                </p>
              
                <div class="equation">
                  h = |0.55 − 0.45| &times; 13.5 m ≈ 1.35 m
                </div>
              
                <p>With the parameters known, the total inertia can be estimated:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I<sub>com</sub> ≈ 6707 kg&middot;m<sup>2</sup></li>
                  <li>m ≈ 3003 kg</li>
                  <li>h ≈ 1.35 m</li>
                </ul>
              
                <div class="equation">
                  I = I<sub>com</sub> + m &middot; h<sup>2</sup><br>
                  I = 6707 + 3003 &times; (1.35)<sup>2</sup> = 12,182 kg&middot;m<sup>2</sup>
                </div>
              
                <p>
                  This value represents the total moment of inertia about the pitch axis, accounting for both the distribution of fuselage mass relative to the rotor axis and the offset of the rotational axis from the center of mass. It combines the intrinsic resistance to rotation (about the CG) with the additional inertia introduced by the spatial separation between the rotor mast and the helicopter’s center of gravity.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  With the total moment of inertia estimated, we now return to the governing equation of the plant model:
                </p>
              
                <div class="equation">
                  &theta;&Prime;&Prime; = (1 / I) &middot; (M − D&theta;&Prime; − K&theta;)
                </div>
              </section>
                            

              <p>
                At this stage, only three variables remain to be defined:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>M</strong> — the input torque applied by the pilot (via control surfaces or actuators)</li>
                <li><strong>D</strong> — the damping coefficient, which accounts for rotational friction or air resistance</li>
                <li><strong>K</strong> — the stiffness coefficient, representing the system’s tendency to return to equilibrium when displaced</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                In the following section, we’ll walk through a reasonable estimation strategy for each of these parameters — grounding them in physical assumptions where possible and using iterative testing where necessary. These values will complete the plant dynamics model and allow for realistic response simulation under both step and disturbance inputs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s begin with the input torque <strong>M</strong>, which is the control effort generated by the pilot through cyclic input and transmitted to the rotor system. In the Simulink model, this torque originates from the output of the PID controller, which compares the desired pitch angle with the actual pitch angle and adjusts the output accordingly. Therefore, <strong>M</strong> is not a fixed value — it varies over time depending on error, controller gains, and system response.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, we estimate the damping coefficient <strong>D</strong>. This term models the resistance the helicopter experiences as it rotates — primarily due to aerodynamic drag and internal mechanical friction. While there is no directly published damping value for the AH-1 Cobra, a common approach is to assume a damping ratio (ζ) and a natural frequency (ω<sub>n</sub>), and then back-calculate <strong>D</strong> using the formula:
              </p>
              
              <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                D = 2ζω<sub>n</sub> · I
              </div>
              
              <p>
                Assuming a damping ratio of 0.7 (critically damped) and a natural frequency of 2 rad/s, and using our previously calculated inertia:
              </p>
              
              <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                D = 2 × 0.7 × 2 × 182,324 ≈ <strong>510,507 N·m·s/rad</strong>
              </div>
              
              <p>
                Finally, the stiffness coefficient <strong>K</strong> accounts for the restoring torque that tends to bring the aircraft back to level flight. Physically, this could result from aerodynamic effects, center-of-gravity offset, or stabilizing surfaces. For modeling purposes, <strong>K</strong> can be derived using:
              </p>
              
              <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                K = ω<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> · I = 4 × 182,324 ≈ <strong>729,296 N·m/rad</strong>
              </div>
              
              <p>
                With <strong>M</strong> generated by the controller and <strong>D</strong> and <strong>K</strong> now defined,
                 all variables in the plant equation have been accounted for. This completes the dynamic structure of the model,
                  enabling the simulation to produce angular acceleration outputs that accurately reflect the helicopter's
                   response to control inputs and external forces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The software used to simulate and model the helicopter’s dynamic response is <strong>MATLAB Simulink</strong>. This platform enables time-domain modeling of control systems with visual block diagrams, allowing for modular testing, parameter tuning, and signal logging.
              </p>

            Solving for θ″ gives the plant equation used in simulation. In the Simulink model, this was implemented
            using two integrators in series to simulate angular velocity and position from torque input. This forms the
            core dynamic system, or "plant," which receives both controller output and external disturbances (e.g.,
            simulated wind torque).
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the system focuses on the pitch axis, this modeling approach generalizes to roll and yaw with
            appropriate inertia values and control strategies. Simulink and MATLAB were used throughout to build, test,
            and tune the system for stability under varying control configurations.
        </p>
        The system was analyzed in the pitch axis, though results can generalize to roll. Simulink and MATLAB were used
        to simulate, tune, and visualize the system response.

        <h2>Test Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simulated Configuration:</strong> Second-order pitch system in Simulink, controlled by PID loop
                with optional disturbance torque input</li>
            <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Step command (0° to 10°), and sinusoidal wind disturbance</li>
            <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> Pitch angle (θ) over time</li>
            <li><strong>Test Matrix:</strong> Three PID configurations:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Set A:</strong> Balanced tuning (P = 2, I = 0.2, D = 0.4)</li>
                    <li><strong>Set B:</strong> Aggressive tuning (P = 3, I = 0.8, D = 0.5)</li>
                    <li><strong>Set C:</strong> No integral (P = 1, I = 0, D = 0)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Logging:</strong> Simulink time series outputs visualized in MATLAB</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results & Analysis</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Set A (P = 2, I = 0.2, D = 0.4):</strong> Settled within ±1° by ~25 seconds; showed balanced
                response with minimal overshoot.</li>
            <li><strong>Set B (P = 3, I = 0.8, D = 0.5):</strong> Faster rise time with some overshoot; still achieved
                steady-state within target window.</li>
            <li><strong>Set C (P = 1, I = 0, D = 0):</strong> Persistent steady-state error (~20°); no integral action
                meant disturbance was not rejected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A MATLAB overlay compared all three controller responses. The system’s transient and steady-state behaviors
            were visualized and confirmed expected theoretical effects of PID term adjustments.
        </p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Proportional gain improves responsiveness but can induce overshoot.</li>
            <li>Integral gain is essential to eliminate bias under constant torque disturbance.</li>
            <li>Derivative gain stabilizes transient behavior and reduces oscillations.</li>
            <li>The observed results matched classic PID controller theory and demonstrated direct control over pitch
                dynamics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All test objectives were met: the pitch system was modeled, stabilized, and characterized across
                multiple configurations.</li>
            <li>Simulink and MATLAB provided effective tools for rapid prototyping, testing, and visualization.</li>
            <li>This project serves as a foundation for future work in multi-axis control or model-based design
                validation.</li>
        </ul>
