      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Modeled a second-order pitch dynamic system for an AH-1 Cobra using Simulink. Designed and tested PID controllers to stabilize pitch angle under command inputs and simulated wind disturbance. Compared multiple control configurations and visualized their stability, transient behavior, and steady-state error. Demonstrated the importance of proportional, integral, and derivative contributions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This equation represents angular acceleration (θ″) resulting from net torque (<em>\∑τ</em>) applied to a rigid body, divided by its moment of inertia (<em>I</em>). It is derived from Newton’s Second Law for rotational systems:
      </p>
            <p class="equation">
             <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
          <em>∑τ</em> = <em>I</em> · θ″
        </div>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
          Here, <em>τ</em> is the net torque acting on the body. In this simulation, we assume it to be a single applied torque <em>M</em> for simplicity.
        </p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
          ⇒ θ″ = <em>M</em> / <em>I</em>
        </div>
          <p>
            To simulate realistic helicopter pitch dynamics, the moment of inertia (I) and total torque must be determined.
          </p>
          <p>
          For this simulation the torques will be a summation of a step input representing pilot control, and a sinusoidal input representing disturbances
          </p>
          <p>
            To estimated the moment of inertia (<em>I<sub>yy</sub></em>) we must use the equation for the moment of inertia for a point mass:
          </p>
            <p>
            The Parallel Axis Theorem can be used to determine the moment of inertia (I) of a rigid body 
            about any axis, given its moment of inertia <em>I<sub>com</sub></em> about a parallel axis through its center of mass.
            The relationship is defined by:
          </p>
          
          <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
            I = I<sub>com</sub> + M · h²
          </div>
          <p>
            Where:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>I</strong> — moment of inertia about the new (offset) axis</li>
            <li><strong>I<sub>com</sub></strong> — moment of inertia about the axis through the center of mass</li>
            <li><strong>M</strong> — total mass of the body</li>
            <li><strong>h</strong> — perpendicular distance between the two parallel axes</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            This theorem is especially helpful when the axis of rotation does not pass through the object’s center of mass — 
            a common scenario in rotary systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Parallel Axis Theorem, we estimate the helicopter's pitch-axis moment of inertia about an axis offset from the center of mass:
            <div style="text-align: center; font-family: Cambria Math, Cambria, serif; font-size: 1.4rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <strong>I = I<sub>com</sub> + M · h²</strong>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            Assuming:
            <ul>
              <li>I<sub>com</sub> ≈ 28,000 kg·m² (estimated for the AH-1 Cobra)</li>
              <li>M = 2,635 kg (empty mass)</li>
              <li>h = 1.5 m (approximate offset distance from center of mass)</li>
            </ul>
            We compute:
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center; font-family: Cambria Math, Cambria, serif; font-size: 1.4rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
            I = 28,000 + 2,635 × (1.5)² = 28,000 + 5,928.75 = <strong>33,928.75 kg·m²</strong>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            This adjusted value of I accounts for the shifted rotation axis and can be used in the Simulink model by setting the Gain block to:
            <br>
      <div style="text-align: center; font-family: Cambria Math, Cambria, serif; font-size: 1.4rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
             <strong>Gain</strong> = 1 / 33,928.75 kg·m² ≈ 2.948 × 10<sup>−5</sup> (1/kg·m²)
      </div>
                 
          <p>
            This gain scales net torque into angular acceleration (θ″), feeding into the two integrator blocks that output angular velocity and position. This estimation improves physical accuracy while keeping the simulation light and adaptable.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Rearranging for θ″ gives the plant equation used in simulation. In the Simulink model, this was implemented using two integrators in series to simulate angular velocity and position from torque input. This forms the core dynamic system, or "plant," which receives both controller output and external disturbances (e.g., simulated wind torque).
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the system focuses on the pitch axis, this modeling approach generalizes to roll and yaw with appropriate inertia values and control strategies. Simulink and MATLAB were used throughout to build, test, and tune the system for stability under varying control configurations.
          </p>
            The system was analyzed in the pitch axis, though results can generalize to roll. Simulink and MATLAB were used to simulate, tune, and visualize the system response.
          </p>

      <h2>Test Description</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simulated Configuration:</strong> Second-order pitch system in Simulink, controlled by PID loop with optional disturbance torque input</li>
        <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Step command (0° to 10°), and sinusoidal wind disturbance</li>
        <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> Pitch angle (θ) over time</li>
        <li><strong>Test Matrix:</strong> Three PID configurations:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Set A:</strong> Balanced tuning (P = 2, I = 0.2, D = 0.4)</li>
            <li><strong>Set B:</strong> Aggressive tuning (P = 3, I = 0.8, D = 0.5)</li>
            <li><strong>Set C:</strong> No integral (P = 1, I = 0, D = 0)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Logging:</strong> Simulink time series outputs visualized in MATLAB</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Analysis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set A (P = 2, I = 0.2, D = 0.4):</strong> Settled within ±1° by ~25 seconds; showed balanced response with minimal overshoot.</li>
        <li><strong>Set B (P = 3, I = 0.8, D = 0.5):</strong> Faster rise time with some overshoot; still achieved steady-state within target window.</li>
        <li><strong>Set C (P = 1, I = 0, D = 0):</strong> Persistent steady-state error (~20°); no integral action meant disturbance was not rejected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A MATLAB overlay compared all three controller responses. The system’s transient and steady-state behaviors were visualized and confirmed expected theoretical effects of PID term adjustments.
      </p>

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Proportional gain improves responsiveness but can induce overshoot.</li>
        <li>Integral gain is essential to eliminate bias under constant torque disturbance.</li>
        <li>Derivative gain stabilizes transient behavior and reduces oscillations.</li>
        <li>The observed results matched classic PID controller theory and demonstrated direct control over pitch dynamics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All test objectives were met: the pitch system was modeled, stabilized, and characterized across multiple configurations.</li>
        <li>Simulink and MATLAB provided effective tools for rapid prototyping, testing, and visualization.</li>
        <li>This project serves as a foundation for future work in multi-axis control or model-based design validation.</li>
      </ul>
