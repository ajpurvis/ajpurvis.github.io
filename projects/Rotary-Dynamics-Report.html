      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Modeled a second-order pitch dynamic system for a rotary-wing aircraft using Simulink. Designed and tested PID controllers to stabilize pitch angle under command inputs and simulated wind disturbance. Compared multiple control configurations and visualized their stability, transient behavior, and steady-state error. Demonstrated the importance of proportional, integral, and derivative contributions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This project evaluates helicopter pitch response using classic control theory. The goal was to build hands-on test engineering skills and simulate real-world challenges such as wind rejection. The pitch model was reduced to a second-order equation:
      </p>
      <p><code>θ″ = M / I</code></p>
      <p>
        The system was analyzed in the pitch axis, though results can generalize to roll. Simulink and MATLAB were used to simulate, tune, and visualize the system response.
      </p>

      <h2>Test Description</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simulated Configuration:</strong> Second-order pitch system in Simulink, controlled by PID loop with optional disturbance torque input</li>
        <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Step command (0° to 10°), and sinusoidal wind disturbance</li>
        <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> Pitch angle (θ) over time</li>
        <li><strong>Test Matrix:</strong> Three PID configurations:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Set A:</strong> Balanced tuning (P = 2, I = 0.2, D = 0.4)</li>
            <li><strong>Set B:</strong> Aggressive tuning (P = 3, I = 0.8, D = 0.5)</li>
            <li><strong>Set C:</strong> No integral (P = 1, I = 0, D = 0)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Logging:</strong> Simulink time series outputs visualized in MATLAB</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Analysis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set A (P = 2, I = 0.2, D = 0.4):</strong> Settled within ±1° by ~25 seconds; showed balanced response with minimal overshoot.</li>
        <li><strong>Set B (P = 3, I = 0.8, D = 0.5):</strong> Faster rise time with some overshoot; still achieved steady-state within target window.</li>
        <li><strong>Set C (P = 1, I = 0, D = 0):</strong> Persistent steady-state error (~20°); no integral action meant disturbance was not rejected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A MATLAB overlay compared all three controller responses. The system’s transient and steady-state behaviors were visualized and confirmed expected theoretical effects of PID term adjustments.
      </p>

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Proportional gain improves responsiveness but can induce overshoot.</li>
        <li>Integral gain is essential to eliminate bias under constant torque disturbance.</li>
        <li>Derivative gain stabilizes transient behavior and reduces oscillations.</li>
        <li>The observed results matched classic PID controller theory and demonstrated direct control over pitch dynamics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All test objectives were met: the pitch system was modeled, stabilized, and characterized across multiple configurations.</li>
        <li>Simulink and MATLAB provided effective tools for rapid prototyping, testing, and visualization.</li>
        <li>This project serves as a foundation for future work in multi-axis control or model-based design validation.</li>
      </ul>
